## Downloading a Repository into Visual Studio Code from GitHub

### Prerequisites
- **Git:** Ensure Git is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps
1. **Open Visual Studio Code:**
   Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Open the Command Palette:**
   Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette.

3. **Clone Repository:**
   Type `Git: Clone` into the Command Palette and press `Enter`.

4. **Enter Repository URL:**
   Provide the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone. This is typically found on the repository's GitHub page and looks like:
https://github.com/verdicaysen/Jacks21FA.git
Press `Enter`.

5. **Choose Local Path:**
Select a local directory where you want to clone the repository. Visual Studio Code will prompt you to choose a location.

6. **Open Cloned Repository:**
After cloning completes, VS Code will ask if you want to open the cloned repository. Click `Open`.

7. **Work with the Repository:**
Once opened, you can view and edit files, commit changes, and push/pull from the remote repository using Visual Studio Code's integrated Git features.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to access the GitHub repository.
- If the repository is private, make sure you have added SSH keys or configured GitHub credentials in your Git client.
- Verify your Git configuration (username, email) in VS Code settings if you plan to commit changes.

By following these steps, you can easily download and work with repositories hosted on GitHub using Visual Studio Code.
