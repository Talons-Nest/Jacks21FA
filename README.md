* This is the result of me wanting to create a palette cleanser project last year while still working on my game Shadow Hold. 

* It was built initially in Linux - and without using additional graphical or game libraries. The goal was to see if I could build a text based RPG using the C# Language, and outputting the game in terminal. This is the result.

* Overall I would say the concept was successful, but it's limited. Obviously as you look at the code, some things were not completed or added - mostly because it was just to prove to myself I could do it and for no other purpose.

* Feel free to use the concepts you find here as a jumping off point to build your own turn based game!
